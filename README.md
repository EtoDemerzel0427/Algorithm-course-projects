# Algorithm-course-projects

This repository includes my algorithm reports in *Spring 2018*.

The coverage of this class is a small subset of the ___Introduction to Algorithms___. 

There are 5 projects in total, we implement the algorithms in different programming languages(as for me, I chose Python), test the correctness and efficiency of our codes, and, write full reports on these topics, analyzing the complexity, etc. For more details please view my reports.

Prof: Wang Xiaoru
